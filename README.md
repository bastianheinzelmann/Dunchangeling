# Dunchangeling
Master thesis project

A dungeon generator based on a genetic algorithm, that produces graphs, which are generated into a layout.

## Installation

ProjectDir\Libs\SFML contains six DLLs, that need to be copied to ProjectDir\x64\Debug
The project DunchangelingTest should be set up as Start Project. 

## Usage

The application is pretty barebone and changes can only be made directly in code.
When started use left and right arrow to switch between partial layouts. 

1. Yellow rooms are special rooms
2. Red room is end room
3. Green room is start room
